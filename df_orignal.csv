SzJ46YA_RaA,Map of Computer Science,"The field of computer science summarised. Learn more at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Computer science is the subject that studies what computers can do and investigates the best ways you can solve the problems of the world with them. It is a huge field overlapping pure mathematics, engineering and many other scientific disciplines. In this video I summarise as much of the subject as I can and show how the areas are related to each other.

A couple of notes on this video:
1. Some people have commented that I should have included computer security alongside hacking, and I completely agree, that was an oversight on my part. Apologies to all the computer security professionals, and thanks for all the hard work!
2. I also failed to mention interpreters alongside compilers in the complier section. Again, I’m kicking myself because of course this is an important concept for people to hear about. Also the layers of languages being compiled to other languages is overly convoluted, in practice it is more simple than this. I guess I should have picked one simple example.
3. NP-complete problems are possible to solve, they just become very difficult to solve very quickly as they get bigger. When I said NP-complete and then ""impossible to solve"", I meant that the large NP-complete problems that industry is interested in solving were thought to be practically impossible to solve.

And free downloadable versions of this and the other posters here. If you want to print them out for educational purposes please do! 

Thanks so much to my supporters on Patreon. If you enjoy my videos and would like to help me make more this is the best way and I appreciate it very much.

🥒ABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

D59Ld3KKM6M,LONDON STREET FOOD,"LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre’s food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats – with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London’s top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What’s to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather’s hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

CdLQ-mJi7rU,30 GENIUS HACKS FOR YOUR LIFE,"GENIUS HACKS FOR ANY SITUATION

These life hacks and tricks are gonna be unexpectedly helpful in numerous life situations.

If you often use eyewear you'll like these hacks.

If your glasses often fogging up, I advise you to rub some plain soap into the glasses and then wipe it up with a napkin as usual.
When your eyeglasses keep slipping down, take two rubber bands, tie them round the temples of the glasses. That's it, no more slipping down!

If you're just trying to pick up a new pair of glasses or buying eyewear for the first time, don't forget to take the table test. Simply put the eyeglasses right on the table and then carefully look at the glasses' temple tips, whether they both reach the table surface or not. If not, it means the temple tips are of different length! It may cause a lot of discomfort while wearing them.

In case you have high myopia of −6.00 diopters or more and accidentally lost your eyewear on the working desk. Grab your phone, turn on the camera and zoom in on the table surface until you see your glasses.

Another nasty problem every four-eyed probably faced - scratches on the lenses. Put some toothpaste on the lens and rub it in.
Did you know how handy plastic bags can be? You can use them as a smartphone case to protect your gadget from the damp and sand when you take it to the beach with you. 

You can cook an awesome puffy omelet using plastic bag as well!

DiL1MtKy9,Ice sheet collapse: The greatest unknown in climate science | Jon Gertner,"Give yourself the gift of knowledge — subscribe to Big Think Edge: http://bit.ly/bigthinkedge

The ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are remnants of the ice age. They're also the wild cards of climate science.

- The science of glaciology and ice sheets is quite new, as methods to measure melting glaciers were only realized with the advent of aviation and lasers.

- The world's sea levels are rising 3mm per year, and of that Greenland's ice sheet contributes 1mm – it is losing between 250 to 300 billion tons of ice per year. Three millimeters total is not much, but ice sheets don't always operate in a linear fashion.

- No human has ever witnessed an ice sheet collapse. It is also such a rare event that models cannot accurately predict what the effect will be. Can we halt global warming before we reach that tipping point?

3aDkSv5R3V,The Most Important UFO Documentary in The History of Disclosure,"Grant Cameron has come into physical possession of some very important ufo documents that imply we have captured craft that is certainly not of this world. Link to documents here https://imgur.com/a/ggIFTfQFurthermore the documents originate from a meeting of high up officials. If the notes are to be believed, Admiral Wilson revealed some incredible information to Dr Davis regarding the apparent existence of a program to reverse engineer technology that was 'not of this Earth'. This program was apparently so secret and locked down that not even Admiral Wilson was allowed full access.",History
JrZGfRdmj,"Introduction to Manufacture Royale, the Enlightened Watchmaker","The first signs of the brand dates from 1770 when French enlightenment philosopher Voltaire established Manufacture Royale in a small town just outside of Geneva. This city is in France and is now known as Ferney-Voltaire in respect to the great thinker.

The manufacture had hundreds of watchmakers and produced important volumes for the time, but it gently disappeared in the vicissitude of time. It was then relaunched in 2010 but the main goal was not to benefit from some kind of far fetched historical link but more to position the brand on the values cherished by Voltaire. 

The first watch that came out was a rather ambitious and very distinctive Minute Repeater, the Opera, which features a unique shell-like deployable system that augments the resonating characteristics of the chiming watch. This watch is till being produced in limited series and it set the stylistic reference for the second collection of the brand, the Androgyne. This watch also proposes a very unique design and the brand rapidly moved on to propose 4 collections, including a Tourbillon in it’s 1770 collection and even a double Tourbillon soon to be introduced. 

One can note that the watches’ mouvements are all in-house developed thanks to a very special partnership with Tech Ebauche, an important supplier of the watchmaking industry.",Manufacturing
1TerTgDEgUE,,"Re-uploaded (again, just in case), since TED's Chris Anderson censored Rupert Sheldrake, along with Graham Hancock, and removed this video and Hancock's from the TEDx YouTube channel. They dared question the Scientistic Orthodoxy, and for that they have been publicly castigated and defamed. Follow this link for TED's dubious statement on the matter (and the many comments appropriately critical of TED's rationale): 


Presumably TED disavows any copyright claim, as they've disavowed association with the videos.

BIO:
Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D. (born 28 June 1942) is a biologist and author of more than 80 scientific papers and ten books. A former Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, where he was a Scholar of Clare College, took a double first class honours degree and was awarded the University Botany Prize. He then studied philosophy and history of science at Harvard University, where he was a Frank Knox Fellow, before returning to Cambridge, where he took a Ph.D. in biochemistry. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, where he was Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology. As the Rosenheim Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he carried out research on the development of plants and the ageing of cells in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge University.

While at Cambridge, together with Philip Rubery, he discovered the mechanism of polar auxin transport, the process by which the plant hormone auxin is carried from the shoots towards the roots.

From 1968 to 1969, based in the Botany Department of the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, he studied rain forest plants. From 1974 to 1985 he was Principal Plant Physiologist and Consultant Physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Hyderabad, India, where he helped develop new cropping systems now widely used by farmers. While in India, he also lived for a year and a half at the ashram of Fr Bede Griffiths in Tamil Nadu, where he wrote his first book, A New Science of Life.

From 2005-2010 he was the Director of the Perrott-Warrick Project funded from Trinity College,Cambridge. He is a Fellow of Schumacher College , in Dartington, Devon, a Fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences near San Francisco, and a Visiting Professor at the Graduate Institute in Connecticut.

He lives in London with his wife Jill Purce and two sons.

He has appeared in many TV programs in Britain and overseas, and was one of the participants (along with Stephen Jay Gould, Daniel Dennett, Oliver Sacks, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Toulmin) in a TV series called A Glorious Accident, shown on PBS channels throughout the US. He has often taken part in BBC and other radio programmes. He has written for newspapers such as the Guardian, where he had a regular monthly column, The Times, Sunday Telegraph, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Sunday Times, Times Educational Supplement, Times Higher Education Supplement and Times Literary Supplement, and has contributed to a variety of magazines, including New Scientist, Resurgence, the Ecologist and the Spectator.

A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Formative Causation (1981). New edition 2009 (in the US published as Morphic Resonance)
The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature (1988)
The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God (1992)

z79yjpwggz4,13 INSANE Creatures Created by Scientists!,"Mankind's ability to control nature is beginning to get out of hand. Animals are being, cloned, hybrids are being created, and jellyfish dna is being used to make all kinds of things glow. Whether they were mnt to exist on this planet or not, it’s already too late, here are insane creatures created by scientists. 



13. Glowfish
What color would you like your fish to be when it glows in the dark? Sunburst orange? Moonrise pink? Starfire Red, Cosmic Blue or Galactic purple! These glofish are the first genetically engineered pets on the market to become available to the public but that doesn’t mean you’ll find them everywhere! Jellyfish dna or dna from other sea creatures is inserted into the embryos of zebrafish which will result in having a glow in dark the dark fish! Other DNA from coral, sea anemone, and sea pansy are used to make them glow different colors.  They were extremely popular when they fire went on the shelves in Taiwan selling for 18 dollars each. It’s believed that they were originally created to be released into water and become fluorescent when toxic water is present. Some people protested the fish like in canada but eventually it was deemed that they weren’t dangerous to anyone so they let the people keep the fish! Many fish have some natural fluorescence so there hasn’t been any negative genetic effects to fish populations just yet. 



12. Superbugs
With all of these organisms whose DNA has unnaturally been altered from genetically modified organisms, you have to wonder what kind of environmental risks. As more and more species are introduced into the world, other animals are going to have to adapt to those changes. Like how we mentioned the superbugs, some bugs who develop immunity to pesticides when they’re over used. This is true for other organisms like bacteria, fungus, weeds etc. A new bacteria theoretically evolve to kill GMO animals who either need excess antibiotics or we’re modified to be more bacteria resistant, leading to massive plagues and much more deadly than ones we had to deal with in the past. Other environment risks include the excess pesticides seeping to our water supply or polluting our soil. As of now, antibiotic genes don’t appear to pose a threat but we don’t know the possibly negative effects just yet. We’ll explain later how scientists try to combat these superbugs later on in this video.


11. Killer Bees
This is what happens when people think it’s fun to hybrid a little too much without thinking about the results and the story behind it seems like something out of a sci fi film. Farmers who were trying to increase the production of honey, crossbred the African honey bee with the European honey bee native to Italy and created a killing machine. This mix of genetics turned them into much more aggressive, insect of nightmares. They don’t mind a good chase either. If you even consider disturbing their nest, they’ll chase you  miles and have known to kill at least 1000 humans. Let’s hope other hybrids won’t turn out like this. 




10. Enviropig
A genetically modified pig, known as the, enviropig, or the frankenswine by many protesters, contains DNA of mice and also even genes from E. Coli bacteria. Sounds like a porkchop you don’t want to eat!. This was to help the pig consume higher amounts of phosphorus more efficiently which is found in genetically modified soy, which also has its own complications. For normal pigs, they would eat soy that contained the phosphorus which would come out in manure and then pose environmental problems. The pigs were later euthanized when Canada decided to pull funding on the GE experiment. Why can’t they just genetically modify the pig with the best bacon or find something better to feed them? Why do they have to use soy to feed these animals.",Science

Science Uprising

Well-known scientists have been preaching a materialistic worldview rather than presenting the public with all the evidence. We are here to change that. The objective scientific evidence does not prove our universe is blind and purposeless.  It does not show we are simply meat machines. It does not prove that evolutionary mechanisms can completely account for the diversity of life on earth. This is what THEY want you to think. Think for yourself and make an informed decision.
Are you ready? The uprising has begun.

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what’s happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven’t- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth’s atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn’t always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren’t able to explain what’s inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren’t around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

zKLH-N_X5j4,The Worst Punishments For Women In History That You Can't Believe,"❀ ♡ ♪    Instead of punishing with death, ancient and modern nations have created many forms of cruel torture exclusively for women ...
10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

XXF0DAfwdtk,The science of sugar | TechKnow,"The science of sugar - TechKnow

The latest World Health Organization data indicates that 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight, with 600 million considered obese. Sugar, in the form of processed, high-in-sugar foods are largely to blame.

Scientists around the world are making a desperate plea to stop an epidemic of obesity. But now, new research goes beyond fat to reveal a risk that could be even greater.

TechKnow explores the science of sugar at the Department of Molecular Bioscience School at the University of California-Davis where cutting-edge research is being done. The project, headed by Dr Kimber Stanhope, put healthy young adults in their 20s on a highly controlled sugary diet for 10 weeks and then measured the effects of that added sugar.

TechKnow explores the correlation between sugar intake and heart disease in young adults.

XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal’s skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth’s body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let’s see what’s next!",History

This stimulant was a methamphetamine based pill, was available in every pharmacy and didn’t require a prescription. This drug was distributed to German soldiers during the course of WW2 and Hitler was no exception to these drug highs receiving drug cocktails from his personal physical Theodor Morell. This film explores the use of drugs in WW2 and looks at the potential effects that drugs could have had on Hitler, soldiers and the war itself.

Peyman’s Channel► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week► 

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He’s from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman’s home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it’s a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it’s a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that’s traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it’s awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman’s house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

K-RSpEbiex8,7 Biggest Lies Told In History Books,"Subscribe! https://goo.gl/JTfP6L

When someone asks us a question “What do we really know about our world?” we might as well reply everything or nothing. And both these answers are wrong and right at the same time. We in Smart Banana want to scour through every page of history books and prove that some facts aren’t facts at all, they are LIES! 

Confused? Of course, we know some things, pieces of general information about the universe, historical events, and personalities. However, when it comes to facts and dates from the past we rely only on one kind of source - history books. Some of us believe that the information we can find in there can’t be 100% trusted, because, let’s put this straight, some of the facts are really doubtful.

Germany's richest state agreed on Sept. 25 to build the country's first commercial high-speed magnetic levitation train line, but officials warned the price tag could be heftier than first thought. Authorities said they had finalized 1.85 billion euros (US$2.6 billion) in financing for the next-generation train line, which is to connect the state capital Munich with its airport, 37 kilometers (23 miles) away.

Starting in 2014, travelers will see the 40-minute trip cut to just 10 by the driverless Transrapid, or Maglev train, which is able to run at 450 kilometers (280 miles) per hour.

The German government will pay 925 million euros, while Bavaria will contribute 490 million, the German state rail company will provide 235 million, the Munich airport will add 100 million and, Siemens and ThyssenKrupp will each provide 50 million with the EU contributing 50 million. But German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck warned that the advertised price was based on an outdated, five-year-old calculation. ""The project will be much more expensive. There is no way that the cost will stay at 1.85 billion euros,"" he said.

The Maglev, designed and built by engineering groups Siemens and ThyssenKrupp, is meant to represent German prowess in rail technology. But a test train collided in September 2006 at 170 kilometers an hour with a parked maintenance vehicle, killing 23 people. Plans to build a working version of the Transrapid have been on hold since the crash.

The only operating line is in China where the Maglev whisks travelers between Shanghai's financial district and the city's Pudong airport along a 30-kilometer track. technology information global technology cnc technology in education gadgets",Manufacturing

A worm drive is a gear arrangement in which a worm (which is a gear in the form of a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.

Like other gear arrangements, a worm drive can reduce rotational speed or transmit higher torque. A worm is an example of a screw, one of the six simple machines.

One of the major advantages of worm gear drive units are that they can transfer motion in 90 degrees.
A gearbox designed using a worm and worm-wheel is considerably smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90° to each other. With a single start worm, for each 360° turn of the worm, the worm-wheel advances only one tooth of the gear wheel. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the ""size of the worm wheel - to - 1"". Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm wheel reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear to achieve the same 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.
There are three different types of gears that can be used in a worm drive.

The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, machined around the circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.[1]

An enveloping (hourglass) worm has one or more teeth and increases in diameter from its middle portion toward both ends.[2]

Double-enveloping wormgearing comprises enveloping worms mated with fully enveloping wormgears. It is also known as globoidal wormgearing. technology information technology news technology in education technology future technology innovation technology solutions bearing machinery cnc",Manufacturing

T-shirts and caps: 

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

FURTHER READING

You can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: 

“An affair is a love – or physical – story between two people, one of whom (at least) is ostensibly committed to someone else. Most importantly, in our times, an affair is a catastrophe, pretty much the greatest betrayal that can befall us, a harbinger of untrammelled suffering, frequently the end of the marriage it has violated and almost always an occasion for fierce moralising and the division of participants into goodies (who have been betrayed) and monsters (who have betrayed).”

CPWxkdgbqw0,Chain Gang of Arizona - The Hardest Prison - Geographic History,"The Last Chain Gang | Hardest Prison - Geographic History.

""Prisoner"" is a legal term for a person who is imprisoned.

In section 1 of the Prison Security Act 1992, the word ""prisoner"" means any person for the time being in a prison as a result of any requirement imposed by a court or otherwise that he be detained in legal custody.

""Prisoner"" was a legal term for a person prosecuted for felony. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for misdemeanour. The abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour by section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 has rendered this distinction obsolete.

Glanville Williams described as ""invidious"" the practice of using the term ""prisoner"" in reference to a person who had not been convicted.

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can’t Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds – which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza – Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‘pink lakes’. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it’s remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you’re visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‘lost world’ because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can’t be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar. The site is unique with its biodiversity and exceptional landscape called the Tsingy - which can be translated into "" where one cannot walk barefoot"".",Science

ViZNgU-Yt-Y,9 Awesome Science Tricks Using Static Electricity!,"Add me on Facebook. (click the LIKE button on Facebook to add me) http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

Music in the video are songs I created.

Song #1: Over Rain

All of these tricks take advantage of static electricity. In general, the lower the humidity, the better these tricks will work. The most impressive one to me is the floating bag trick. Depending on the conditions, you can float an entire grocery sack. 

1. Hover Plate: (You need Styrofoam Plates and a cloth) Styrofoam plates are great for static electricity tricks. When you give them a charge and hold one above the other, you can feel an incredible amount of resistance.

2. Can Can Go (You need a coke can, PVC pipe and a cloth) This is a classic but still fun. Try standing the can up and then tip it over with static, or try pulling 2 cans at the same time.

3. Stick Around (You need a small wooden stick, glass jar, thread, tape, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is fun because half of the time the wooden stick will come toward the pvc pipe, and other times it will move away from the pipe. When it moves away, it will stick the the side of the jar and remain there for a period of time. It also fun to use as large a jar as possible to increase the dramatic effect of the pipe moving the stick from such a large distance.

4. Bubble Trouble (You need bubble solution, plexi-glass, PVC pipe, straw and a cloth. This is a fun trick because the bubbles change their shape and move when the pvc pipe is near. It's also fun to create bubbles inside of bubbles to watch the effect of the static electricity. And also create multiple bubbles on the sheet and watch them all travel toward the pipe.

5. Dancing Balls (You need styrofoam balls, aluminum foil, plexi-glass, cloth, and an area to keep the balls from escaping. This trick is really impressive but can be a bit difficult to recreate. When the plexi-glass plate is charged and placed over the balls, they all jump up and stick to the bottom of the glass. For a few moments they travel around sporadically until they finally settle. But when you put your finger near the glass, they all start jumping around. It's also fun to use these balls with styrofoam plates / cups. If you place the ball on a charged plate, it will shoot off of the plate, or stick to it, even if the plate is held sideways or upside down.

6. Water Bender (You need a cup that you can poke a hole in,  water, PVC pipe and a cloth. This is  a classic but still fun. 

7. Balloon Fight (You need balloons, thread, PVC pipe and cloth. When the conditions are just right, the balloon can almost levitate about the pipe. But most of the time you can have fun pushing the balloons around with the charged pipe.

8. Electroscope (You need, steel wire, jar, straw, aluminum foil, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is really impressive to see in person. A really cool effect to try, which you can see in this video, is to rub the cloth on the pvc pipe from several feet away from the jar. When you run the pipe, you can see the aluminum foil pieces in the jar, moving. I was able to stand as far as 5 feet away and still see the effect.

9. Wingardium Leviosa (You need very light weight / thin plastic bags, cloth, PVC pipe) This is my favorite trick. Again, with the correct conditions, you can get the plastic pieces  to float over foot above the pipe. Produce bags from the grocery store work great. You can float an entire produce bag in the right conditions.

Cattle Decapitation ""Manufactured Extinct"" from the album ""The Anthropocene Extinction"".
LYRICS:
Manufactured Extinct

In the beginning of this, the anthropocene era
Life was pristine, resonating impact …the instigator’s arrival
Densely populating smashing biodiversity

Altered climate accelerating exacerbated by our human activities

We used it up, we wore it out, we made it do what we could have done without

Machines to make machines fabricating the end of all living things
Sacrificing all morality, the ends never justify the means

Technology defines the ages - Our human history burns its own pages

Under the sun and in the light of day we throw this all away 
Instinctual devotion to annihilation
Eradication, mass predation - manufactured extinction
The powers that be are you and me

These enemies of inconvenience = undertakers

Entire species erased
Millions of acres defaced
Nonrenewable 

Fuck this flesh
Curating distress
Composing our dirge
True nature emerged

Under the sun and in plain sight a tragedy has been designed
by hands of cultures intertwined in greed and cruel ways of life",Manufacturing
7hfJCjSvkY,,"क्या आपको ये देख कर कुछ महसूस हुआ? Science Of Brain Behind Why Things Appear Scary

Hello friends, Human brain is wonderful organ that has helped us animals survive since ancient times. Fear is a strong emotion necessary for our biology. But have you ever wondered what fear actually is? Why do things appear scary and unreal to us and what is the science behind it. Well, for that we will need to do some research, investigation and analysis in scientific fields like neurology, neuroscience, medical science and human biology. We will need to understand how the human mind works and how the chemistry within it drives action. Strange and mysterious also weird and creepy things bring fear within us because they make us feel unknown. And anything that is unfamiliar may be seen as a threat to our physiology. Our neurons fire a series of chemical reaction necessary for our survival. This video can help you overcome your fears and increase you mental health.

RH_lsl62M0,Doctor Tries Disgusting Science Experiment Kit | Doctor Mike,"It seems you really enjoyed when I have my nephews in my videos so since Ari was staying with me for a bit I decided to unbox one of the science games I recently bought. This one is called ""disgusting science"" where you make slime snot, stomach simulations, and more! 

I would give this kit 3.5/5 stars as it does a great job of teaching basic science/health concepts through the activities and even has solid explanations. However, the kit has few tools and you need A LOT of supplemental equipment like bread, vinegar, containers, etc. If you are looking to learn some basic health and have some laughs making slime through science this can be a good kit for you to check out. 

Ari and I definitely shared more than one laugh on this simple science experiment. As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

zIjWMGl,Today in history: Netaji was sent for indefinite detention on 2nd July 1940,"Subhash Chandra Bose was one of India’s most respected freedom fighter. Bose is credited with building India's first armed force in the form of Azad Hind Fauj. Bose, who had cleared the Indian Civil Service examination in 1920, quit his civil service job on April 23, 1921. For two decades after this, Bose had been associated with the Indian National Congress as a young, radical leader. Subhas Chandra Bose was jailed 11 times for his involvement in India's freedom struggle. However, he was released in December the same year when he sat on a hunger strike.

A question that many of us have asked is why are we here, it's perhaps one of the questions that we'll never have an answer for. It's unknown why we are here, but one thing that is known is that the human body is incredible. 

Two leading scientists have come forward and said that the human brain is a biological computer and the consciousness of a human being is a program that runs by the brain's computer. It's believed that within the human brain there resides around 86 billion brain cells. The soul is something that has made many people put forward different theories.

2. MAASAI HOMESTEAD (Manyatta): Raw Blood and Kidney + Goat Roast + Blood Soup
ADDRESS: Kimana Sanctuary, Amboseli 
OPEN: N/A

Our next stop on our Kenyan Food Tour brought us to the Maasai Homestead. We we watched how the men of the tribe sometimes prepare and roast a whole goat. This usually occurs when the Maasai men spend the night out in the plains after roaming far from home to graze the livestock. Per tradition, they don’t eat in front of women. They however take back certain pieces for the women, once they are done feasting. This bonding time with the Maasai men is said to build fraternity. 

🇰🇪 RAW BLOOD AND KIDNEY: The goat is slaughtered and the blood is collected in a sufuria. This is drank fresh. Cuts like the kidney are also eaten raw. 

🇰🇪 GOAT ROAST: The legs are skewered on makeshift spears, and are roasted upright around a central fire. Once ready, this will be cut in front of everyone and passed around the circle.

🇰🇪 BLOOD SOUP: The soup is made using herbs to cleanse the system. The intestines are boiled then fried in their own fat, and is then served. The liver is also roasted medium-rare and passed around in the circle until it is gone.

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP into Karachi, Pakistan, for a FULL ON street food tour! We're tasting INCREDIBLE Golden Chicken Biryani, different from Golden Pulao, but still an amazingly delicious Pakistani food!

Karachi is one of the oldest and most vibrant cities in the world and has one of the BEST street food scenes too! You need to travel to Pakistan to try the street food, especially the BIRYANI in Karachi!

Today, we're bringing you Foodrangin' for LOTS of TRADITIONAL and AUTHENTIC Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING GOLDEN Chicken Biryani at Al Rehman Biryani! We're also having brain takatak (katakat) and some incredible Pakistani seafood in Karachi too!

This is RARE and DELICIOUS, and worth traveling to Pakistan for! You have to taste this food at least once in your lifetime!

When you travel to Karachi, you will fall in  love with the street food as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Chicken biryani, where the masters prepare biryani for 100's of people every day! This is all prepared by local chefs in Karachi using PURE karachi style masalas!

It was found in downtown Karachi in an old area where there is street food everywhere! The basmati rice was the FLUFFIEST I've ever tasted and the potatoes were MASSIVE and soft! 

After this, we're going DEEPER into Karachi to Burns road, where there are 1000's of street foods and stalls to visit! This is before we bring you to a MASSIVE Pakistani SEAFOOD feast on the beachside in Karachi, right on the Arabian sea! 

Next up, we're going to a local Pakistan street food served right on the street side, the KARACHI HALEEM, found right on burns road! We got invited into the kitchen to see how the chefs prepare the haleem using their Pakistani recipes, it was absolutely amazing to watch it being prepared! There was so much chicken, masala, and pulses all being ground up to make the haleem! But this was just the beginning, after this we found the most INSANE Street Food in Pakistan!

After tasting the haleem at Karachi Haleem, it was evening time and needed some street food to try before going to our Pakistani seafood feast. We found ourselves in a local alley in Karachi and found the CRAZIEST BRAIN FRY (bheja fry) with tomato! It was full of masala, brain, and also tons of oil! To be honest, it was quite heavy for me, but maybe once in a whilie it's OK to eat!  

After this, we're meeting with our buddy Ali and he is taking us to his friends Shehroze and Alizeh's seaside home for a HUGE Pakistani SEAFOOD feast right on the ARABIAN SEA!  To me, this was some of the most unique food in Pakistan, especially being able to watch the cooking process of all the different seafoods! We had red snapper with a tamarind sauce, HUGE lobsters cooked in masala and ghee, crab claw LOLLIPOPS, calamari, shrimp curry, and more! It was SO TASTY!

After this, the next day,  we made our way back into Karachi to visit the super famous Fish TAKATAK (katakat) at Mashalla Takatak! It uses sole fish and tons of masala, onions (piyaz), and coriander! It was amazing to watch the chopping and grilling of the fish in oil! Another famous seafood dish to try in Karachi! It was so UNIQUE!

And for our final meal, we went to taste a WHOLE LAMB leg roast over the fire!!! It was amazing to taste, and the cooking process took over 2 hours! As it was being prepared, we watched the master chefs sprinkle local masala over it and also sprinkle it with lime after it was done!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

There is much more street food in our Pakistani food videos series, get ready for the playlist of a lifetime!!

ZRDpP5zFvt4,Manufacture - Armed Forces (1988),"Released in 1988 for Nettwerk.
The video is packed with useful cliches... sexy women, a lot of militaria and tough guys for a hard masculine sound called ""electronic body music"" - a label brand given by Front 242. One musician is acting very funny behind his synthesizer, isn't he? 
B.T.W: The music video was directed and edited by band member Brian Bothwell and he did a really great job in camera and editing, I think. And please watch the set decoration. How extensive could be a clip for an independent band in the 80ies... That's unbelievable today.

Lyrics

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broken inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life",History

Top 5 Creepiest Tales From European History - Part 1


We’re back at it again guys - because as we all know, nothing goes better together than horror and history - and yes, I’m including both Peanut Butter and Jam in that equation - because the horrifying tales of European History are just too damn good to pass up, particularly when it comes to sandwiches. As we briefly touched on in the first part of this series - Europe is a mystifying place - filled with more tortuous tales of intrigue, deceit - superstition - and just plain old misfortune - than a George R.R Martin novel, because after all - he knows more so than anyone, that truth is always stranger than fiction

KoGYObRNn6A,Michio Kaku: There are 2 types of god. Only one is within the boundary of science.,"Give yourself the gift of knowledge — subscribe to Big Think Edge: http://bit.ly/bigthinkedge

Does God exist? The answer rests outside the ""normal"" boundaries of science.

- Science is about natural law, while religion is about ethics. As long as you keep these two separate, Kaku says, there's no problem at all. 

- Problems arise, however, when the natural sciences begin to ""pontificate upon ethics"" and when religious people begin to pontificate about natural law.

- Albert Einstein believed in the ""god of Spinoza"" — not a personal god, but one who has set order and harmony in the fabric of the universe. ""You can put the laws of physics as we know them on a simple sheet of paper — amazing! It didn't have to be that way,"" says Kaku.

- The existence of God is not testable because such a review is not reproducible or falsifiable, as most scientific investigations are. In this sense, Kaku says the question and answer whether God exists rests outside the ""normal"" boundaries of science.

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU). His latest book is ""The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth""

Science Uprising

Well-known scientists have been preaching a materialistic worldview rather than presenting the public with all the evidence. We are here to change that. The objective scientific evidence does not prove our universe is blind and purposeless.  It does not show we are simply meat machines. It does not prove that evolutionary mechanisms can completely account for the diversity of life on earth. This is what THEY want you to think. Think for yourself and make an informed decision.
Are you ready? The uprising has begun.

8QhuDJvZweI,,"Exploring outer space is awesome, but what if there are places right here on Earth that are just as incredible and jaw-dropping? Luckily for you, you live on Planet Earth, a place that holds secrets so wild and baffling that even scientists can’t always explain them! 

Have you ever heard about the Boiling River in the Amazon or never-ending light storm? Can you believe that there’s a place on Earth with its own ecosystem and atmosphere, similar to another planet? Maybe you wanna see dancing lights in the sky? Well, the residents of Hessdalen Valley, Norway, can enjoy them every night! The world is full of amazing things, so prepare to be amazed as you learn about 7 of the most unbelievable mysteries and phenomena.

SUMMARY:
- What’s interesting about this waterfall is that it has 2 different bodies of falling water. One side has water falling into another body of water, Lake Superior; the other one has water that falls straight into a huge natural hole in the ground. Where does this water lead? No one seems to know!
- While today we have machines that can help us lift heavy materials to build giant buildings and monuments, back in the days when Stonehenge was built, no one had access to this type of technology.
- In Hessdalen Valley, brightly colored lights appear in the sky in different colors and shapes. For the last 4 decades (and possibly longer!), this phenomenon has continued to puzzle scientists.
- Deep in the Amazon rainforests lies a flowing river in the forested region of Mayantuyacu that boasts temperatures so hot that any person or animal that falls into it literally boils alive from the inside out.
- Movile Cave, located in Southeastern Romania, remained closed in complete darkness for a whopping 5.5 million years! Scientists carved out an opening to the cave and found that a completely sustained ecosystem was thriving inside!
- Circles of Namibia are almost perfect and range anywhere from 10 to 65 ft in diameter. Many scientists have offered up theories as to why these circles appear instead of other more random shapes.
- But in Western Venezuela, over the mouth of the Catatumbo River, there’s a lightning storm that seems to be running on Energizer batteries — it just keeps going and going! Once the clock strikes 7 PM, the lightning storm begins and doesn’t relent for another 10 long hours.

It can't be seen directly through telescopes or with our eyes, but astronomers know it's there. In fact, there are supermassive black holes at the hearts of many galaxies. How do astronomers know these monsters lurk in the galactic cores? They use a variety of methods to study light as it passes by a black hole and they also study the region around a black hole to understand how it affects nearby clouds of gas, dust, and even stars.  Currently, the supermassive black hole in the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A*, is a fairly quiet one, and astronomers monitor it in many wavelengths of light to understand its actions.",Science

kwPE_SW3CR8,AMAZING Mandyali Dham (Himachali Thali) + SOFTEST Parati Kulcha | Shimla Food Walk - Part 1/3,"► Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoo...

From Kasauli we drove to Shimla in search of local and popular delicacies. This hill station fascinates every visitor with its terrific outdoors and unique appeal form the British Raj. The Himachal capital is always buzzing with tourists as here, one finds, panoramic views of the snow clad Himalayas, tiny paths along the pine forests, Elizabethan-style architecture and a delectable food culture, all of which makes it resemble a fairy tale settings. 

The only and the best way to explore the central part of the town is by walking through the winding paths and stairs leading uphill and downhill. In this delightful gastronomic journey across this pretty town, we were joined by our awesome host Savitoj who walked us through the food scene enthralling us with historical references and tales.

Our first stop was the Indian Coffee House whose ambience takes people back in time and gives them a taste of the timeless beverages and food. Here we tried the coffee, bread toast and Sambar Vada. Food and coffee both were decent but the  ambience made it special.

Next we tried an amazingly hot Gulab Jamun from the iconic snack shop Baljees that is local favourite for quick snacks. After this we went to Sharma Chat to taste the unique Parati Kulcha. This spicy and savoury dish was super delectable. Its a must try delicacy in Shimla.

From there we went to Vijay Sweets to have tea along with some of their very famous tea time snacks. The assortment of sweet and savoury snacks was quite interesting especially the Toshe. 

Then we tried the Spoonie from the renowned Trishool Bakery that was full of fresh bakery stuffs and eager customers. At last we went on to try the traditional celebratory food from Himachal Pradesh known as the Dham. Its a hearty and nutritious platter consisting of choicest delicacies from across the state that is  made with local ingredients. We tried it at a restaurant named Himachali Rasoi. This Dham was specially from the Mandi district. It was indeed a scrumptious spread especially the Rajma Ka Madra.

This culinary sojourn with our genial host Savitoj was truly heartwarming. See you soon at some new destination.

Astronomers have cataloged eight planets, 6,500 comets and more than 525,000 asteroids, but a mysterious thing happened on October 19, 2017 in Hawaii that grabbed the attention of millions of people and scientists around the world because what they discovered was unlike anything seen before. The first ever recorded interstellar object was found to have entered our solar system somewhere from deep space. It was given the name Oumuamua, named after the Hawaiian term for ‘scout’ or ‘messenger from afar’, and its path showed that it was not gravitationally bound to our own solar system. But what was this strange object, and where did it come from?

Society has always been in a bare knuckle fight with Mother Nature. Going toe to toe with some of her more interesting jabs and punches. Testing ourselves, and oftentimes losing, to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, Tsunamis and meteor strikes. We’ve become accustomed to these attacks… But… every so often, nature has a trick up her sleeve; an Ace that comes out of nowhere and really floors us. 

One two strikes that although natural have no rational cause. Today we are going to list 10 strange unexplained phenomena that stomp science.

Special thank you to Dan Gray, who took us on this Korean street food tour. You can follow him at  and    

STREET FOOD NETFLIX - Seoul, South Korea

I did enjoy watching the Street Food Netflix show, especially the amazing cinematography and the amazing stories of the people behind the food. However, there wasn’t much emphasis, if any, on the eating part of the street food. So I happen to be in Seoul for a few days, and I happen to know Dan Gray (), who helped arrange the Seoul Street Food Netflix episode, and so he took us on the same tour, except this time, focused on eating everything.

Here are the places covered in the Street Food Netflix, Korean street food in Seoul episode:

Gwangjang Market - Most of the entire episode was filmed at the famous Gwangjang Market, a market I’ve been to many times, and is a must visit for Korean food lovers in Seoul.

Yoonsun Cho - Gohyang Kalguksu Stall - Most of the Netflix Seoul episode was based around Yoonsun Cho and her incredible kalguksu, hand made knife cut noodles. They were very home-style tasting, very comforting and delicious. She also serves a number of other dishes including nangmyeon, and seaweed noodles, all of which were very good. Her sauce is also amazing, and her kimchi. Price - 5,000 KRW ($4.21) per bowl

Honglim Banchan Stall - Probably the most delicious food on this entire Korean street food tour Netflix episode was the soy marinated crab from Honglim Banchan Stall. The crab was melt in your mouth and the marinade was perfect. Even better is when she scooped out some roe and mixed it with rice in the shell.

Bindae-tteok stall - There’s an entire section of Korean street food dedicated to bindae-tteok at Gwangjang Market. Along with these crispy mung bean pancakes, we also ordered Yukhoe, Korean raw beef with egg and pear. Price - 30,000 KRW ($25.27) total

Dongdaemun Food Street - Finally, the last thing in the Street Food Netflix episode of Seoul was the Baffle, a unique creation of rice made into a waffle, filled and topped with all sorts of interesting things. Price - 4,000 KRW ($3.37)

It was a fun Korean street food tour, and we all had a great time eating and meeting the friendly vendors from the show.

I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

6m8PmMQK76,Early Motorcycle Manufacture - The Rover Imperial (*silent movie),"Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/2kKTBIM

www.iomtt.com

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

The explosion of Supernova
According to the leading scientists, two stars will collide in the constellation cygnus. As a result, a supernova will occur, and a huge amount of energy will be ejected into space. It will be brighter that the light from a majority of stars in the galaxy. The consequences will be visible to the naked eye from the earth's surface. It will take place in 2022.

Take this egg and place in a glass full of maple syrup and wait for 1 day. The egg will shrink. After that place the same egg in a glass with water, also you can add some dye. And again, wait for a day. Check out the result!

We also shout out ten artists who are willing to take freelance gigs.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

4PIucWyAr-E,Michael Shermer with Andrew Seidel — Why Christian Nationalism is Un-American (SCIENCE SALON # 73),"Listen to the Podcast (audio) version:
http://bit.ly/ScienceSalon73

In this important new book, The Founding Myth: Why Christian Nationalism is Un-American, constitutional attorney and scholar at the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF), Andrew L. Seidel, begins by explaining what apparently religious language is doing in the Declaration of Independence. Does this prove that America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles? Are the Ten Commandments the basis for American law? What, exactly, was the role of religion in America’s founding? Christian nationalists assert that our nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and advocate an agenda based on this popular historical claim. But is this belief true? The Founding Myth answers the question once and for all. Seidel builds his case point by point, comparing the Ten Commandments to the Constitution and contrasting biblical doctrine with America’s founding philosophy, showing that the Bible contradicts the Declaration of Independence’s central tenets. Thoroughly researched, this persuasively argued and fascinating book proves that America was not built on the Bible and that Christian nationalism is, in fact, un-American.

Seidel and Shermer also discuss:

• the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade and he explains how this could happen in the next 3–5 years
• new laws being passed in many southern states enacting the teaching of Christianity and the bible in public schools
• the thousands of letters that the FFRF receives every year from both secularists and members of minority religions who feel and believe that their rights are being threatened and even violated by Christian nationalists
• the “religious exemption” for vaccinations and why it’s nonsense
• why Christianity was not responsible for the abolition of slavery
• how the South justified slavery in the Civil War
• how Christian nationalists cherry pick biblical passages to fit current secular moral trends
• the historical treatment of women in Christianity
• the historical treatment of homosexuals in Christianity, and
• why moral progress must come from the bottom up from cultural change as well as top down from changing laws.

Human history is truly a swinging pendulum of ups and downs. The centuries have been sprinkled with both terrible, bleak events, and beautiful hopeful moments.

IDX96rSXUM,इंडिया गेट का इतिहास || India Gate Delhi History in Hindi || Facts about India Gate in Hindi,"The India Gate भारत द्वार(originally called the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the ""ceremonial axis"" of New Delhi, India[1], formerly called Kingsway.

India Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2][3] The India Gate, even though a war memorial, evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch like the Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.[2]

In 1972, following the Bangladesh Liberation war, a small simple structure, consisting of a black marble plinth, with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet, bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the soaring Memorial Archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the Flame of the Immortal Soldier, since 1971 has served as India's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. India Gate is counted among the largest war memorials in India.

The India Gate situated in Delhi,was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (I.W.G.C), which came into existence in December 1917 for building war graves and memorials to soldiers killed in the First World War[4]

The foundation stone of the All-India War Memorial was laid on 10 February 1921, at  PM, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a solemn soldierly ceremony attended by Officers and Men of the British Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the Commander in Chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy.[5] On the occasion, the viceroy said, ""The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live for ever in the annals of this country"", and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, ""known and unknown"" would inspire, future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and ""no less valour"".[5]

The King, in his message, read out by the Duke said ""On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep"" in the thoughts of future generations ""the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men of the British Indian Army who fought and fell"". During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force), were honoured with title of ""Royal"" in recognition of the distinguished services and gallantry of the British Indian Army during the Great War"".[5]

Ten years after the foundation stone laying ceremony, on February 12, 1931, the All India War Memorial was inaugurated by Viceroy Lord Irwin, who on the occasion said ""those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record.""[2]

In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the War memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run along the Yamuna river, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.[6][7]

The India gate, which is illuminated every evening, from  to , is a major tourist attraction. Cars, traveled through India Gate until it was closed to traffic. The Republic Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the India Gate.

Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier, is a structure consisting of black marble plinth, with reversed L1A1 Self-loading rifle, capped by war helmet, bound by four urns, each with the permanent light (jyoti) from (CNG) flames,[13] erected under the India Gate in the wake Liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971 to commemorate Indian soldiers killed in the defense of their country. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 26 January 1972, the 23rd Republic Day. Since the installation of the Amar Jawan Jyoti, in 1971, it has served as India's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Amar Jawan Jyoti is manned round the clock by soldiers drawn from the three services of the Indian armed forces. Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti on 26 January, by the Prime Minister of India, and Chiefs of Armed Forces; on Vijay Diwas, and on Infantry Day.[14] Infantry Day, is the day Indian Infantry air landed at Srinagar on 27 October 1947 to stop and defeat the Pakistani mercenaries attack on Jammu and Kashmir. 68th Infantry day was marked by ‘Wreath Laying’ ceremony at ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’ by Chief of Army Staff, Gen Dalbir Singh, and by Lt Gen Chandra Shekhar (Retd) on behalf of Infantry veterans.

Lyrics

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don’t mean that we can’t live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
(Oh, yeah)
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect

HQx5Be9g16U,10 Amazing Science Tricks Using Liquid!,"Add me on Facebook (click LIKE on Facebook to add me) - http://www.facebook.com/brusspup
Download the music in this video:
Song #1: Abyss - iTunes: 
Amazon download: 

Song #2: Over Rain
iTunes: 
Amazon: 

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. 

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass. Turn the smaller glass carefully and watch the colors mix. Turn it back and watch them unmix.

6VYB3a9bbiA,24 CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS YOU`VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"We have a lot of things stored in the kitchen, with which you can put interesting experiments for children. And for yourself to make a couple of discoveries and wonder why you never noticed this before? 
One of the most interesting experiments you can do at home is elastic eggs! You have no idea how that's possible? It's easy! This experiment is a classic example of an acid base reaction. This reaction dissolves the shell, but leaves the inner membrane intact, creating a bare egg.
Put the egg in a glass jar. Add vinegar. Pour enough vinegar to cover the egg, and a little more. First the eggs swim, but then they sink.
Watch the bubbles! Within a minute of adding vinegar, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide appear on the eggshell. This is one part of the chemical reaction that takes place inside the jar.
Close the lid and leave for a few days, and can be a week. The egg will get a little bigger. The brown color of the eggshell pales. A layer of scale appears on the surface of the vinegar. You can replace the vinegar in a couple of days.
After a week, carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. Wash and wipe gently. You will see that the eggshell has become soft, it is pliable even with a light touch. It's like a naked egg!
Naked eggs are really cool. The inner membrane remains intact, so the eggs are quite fragile. They can be squeezed gently. The eggs are translucent, so you can see the yolk, which, interestingly, always floats up.
If you drop a bare egg from a very low height (about 2-3 cm), it is likely to bounce like a rubber ball. (Be careful, it gets dirty and can burst!).

8yfkENiAXFM,Amazon Street Food in Belém - UNBELIEVABLE TACACÁ + 13 Lady’s Cooked Lunch at Market in Brazil!,"🎥Unseen SUPERFOOD in Amazon Jungle: https://youtu.be/iGU6dXuIcJE
🍌Banana Chips available now!! 
👕T-shirts: 

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

BELÉM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It’s all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cachaça - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cachaça, Brazil’s sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it’s serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There’s nothing like Amazon fruits and here’s the juices we tried: Cupuaçu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here’s where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Belém!

Tacacá Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacacá, I still can’t believe how good it is, and how it’s not loved all over the world! We also had Vatapá. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Rosário Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Rosário Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Belém, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

The Thirty Years War involved a lot of countries, and a lot of battles, and it was terrible for everyone involved, as wars have aa historical tendency to be. At the same time, disease and hunger were common, thanks in part to the climate change of the Little Ice Age. Get ready for some misery.

From the late Bronze Age to the Revolt of 1857 and India's Struggle for Freedom, this compilation gives you a rare glimpse into history. Watch them come alive!

The Tamil Dynasty of the Pandyas, who ruled first from Korkai near present day Tuticorin, before shifting to Madurai, from as early as 600 BC BC had a thriving shipping and trading with Greece and Rome to the Greek and Persian invasions from land and sea. To the massive Chola Empire that spread to the neighbouring countries of South East Asia, The Mauryas in Northern India who conquered most of India except the Tamilians and had great Kings like Chandragupta Maurya and Asoka the Great, The Chera Dynasty from the South, Harshavardhana, The Pallavas, The Rajputs from the Central and North Western India, the Mughals, Sivaji Maharaj and the Marathas, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore and Rani of Jhansi , Laxmibai.

GjBp1cDMukE,Making history: Trump becomes first ever sitting US president to enter N.Korea,"President Trump has made history, becoming the first sitting U.S. leader to enter North Korea. He briefly stepped across the border while meeting the North's leader Kim Jong-Un for an impromptu summit between the pair. Kim said he was surprised that Donald Trump's offer to get together was announced on Twitter - before adding the American President's visit was a great sign of willingness for relations to improve. Yet sanctions on the reclusive state remain for now - an issue that's previously led to a stalemate in talks.

""Khajuraho"" redirects here. For the town, see
Khajuraho (town) . For the constituency, see
Khajuraho (Lok Sabha constituency) .
The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of
Hindu , Buddhist and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh , India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi . They are one of the UNESCO
World Heritage Sites in India. [1][2] The temples are famous for their nagara -style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures . [3]
Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela Rajput dynasty. [4] Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers. [2] Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art. [5]
The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and
Jainism , suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region. [6]
Location
The Khajuraho monuments are located in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh , in Chhatarpur district , about 620 kilometres (385 mi) southeast of New Delhi.The temples are located near a small town also known as Khajuraho, [7] with a population of about 20,000 people (2001 Census).
Khajuraho is served by Civil Aerodrome Khajuraho (IATA Code: HJR), with services to Delhi, Agra, Varanasi and Mumbai. [8] The site is also linked by the Indian Railways service, with the railway station located approximately six kilometres from the entrance to the monuments .
The monuments are about 10 kilometres off the east-west National Highway 75 , and about 50 kilometres from the city of Chhatarpur , which is connected to the state capital Bhopal by the SW-NE running
National Highway 86 .
The 10th century Bhand Deva Temple in Rajasthan was built in the style of the Khajuraho monuments and is often referred to as 'Little Khajuraho'.
History
The Khajuraho group of monuments was built during the rule of the Chandela dynasty. The building activity started almost immediately after the rise of their power, throughout their kingdom to be later known as Bundelkhand . [9] Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga . Yashovarman's legacy is best exhibited by The Lakshmana Temple . Vishvanatha temple best highlights King Dhanga's reign. [10] :22 The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King
Vidyadhara . [11] The temple inscriptions suggest many of the currently surviving temples were complete between 970 and 1030 CE, with further temples completed during the following decades. [6]
The Khajuraho temples were built about 35 miles from the medieval city of Mahoba, [12] the capital of the Chandela dynasty, in the Kalinjar region. In ancient and medieval literature, their kingdom has been referred to as Jijhoti, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-to and Jejakabhukti. [13]
Khajuraho was mentioned by Abu Rihan-al-Biruni ,

Khajuraho was mentioned by Abu Rihan-al-Biruni , the Persian historian who accompanied Mahmud of Ghazni in his raid of Kalinjar in 1022 CE; he mentions Khajuraho as the capital of Jajahuti. [14] The raid was unsuccessful, and a peace accord was reached when the Hindu king agreed to pay a ransom to Mahmud of Ghazni to end the attack and leave.

This talk presents the findings and methodology from a team of investigative journalists, hackers and data scientists who delved into the parallel universe of fraudulent pseudo-academic conferences and journals; Fake science factories, twilight companies whose sole purpose is to give studies an air of scientific credibility while cashing in on millions of dollars in the process. Until recently, these fake science factories have remained relatively under the radar, with few outside of academia aware of their presence; but the highly profitable industry is growing significantly and with it, so are the implications. To the public, fake science is indistinguishable from legitimate science, which is facing similar accusations itself. Our findings highlight the prevalence of the pseudo-academic conferences, journals and publications and the damage they can and are doing to society.",Science

Er9D00DXQQ,Science Has Found Proof of the Existence of God!,"How to be Saved from Hell:

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:9

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: Romans 8 

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) 

Sponsored by MADE.COM. Supported by the American Friends of the V&A

NTyoMYF51WQ,Today in History: Hong Kong reverts to China after 156 years as British colony in 1997,"In the intervening night of June 30 and July 1, the colony of Hong Kong officially reverted to Chinese sovereignty, ending 156 years of British rule. The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, commonly known as the handover of Hong Kong. It was a transformation of control over the United Kingdom's then colony of Hong Kong. After this, it ceased to be a British dependent territory and  became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. The returned territory comprised Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. These territories were respectively surrendered to Britain in 1842 and 1860. The transfer was arranged to coincide with the expiration of this lease on the previous day, 30 June 1997. Hong Kong was Britain's last substantial overseas territory, with a population of approximately 6.5 million in 1997.
